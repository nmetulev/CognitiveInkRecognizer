# YOU ROCK!

By using this app, you are helping create a machine learning model!

You will be asked you to draw a shape. Simply use your mouse, pen or finger to draw the shape on the canvas. Keep the drawing simple and quick. 

Example for STICK FIGURE:

![stick_figure](stick_figure_example.png)

Once you are satisfied with your masterpiece, hit the :heavy_check_mark:. This will upload the shape to Azure Custom Vision.

If you made a mistake, just hit the :x: to clear the canvas.

To just skip the current shape, hit the :arrows_counterclockwise:

Each shape will be random and you might be asked to draw the same shape few times. The more shapes you draw, the better :)

Have Fun!
